# BetterBatteryLife
An application to provide better standby time on Android 7 &amp; up devices.

This application allows optimized Android DOZE settings ( from XDA-developers ) to be set on non-rooted devices to greatly improve their standby times.
- With these doze settings, phone sensor motion ( putting it in your pocket ) will not accidentally wake up the phone, which causes bad battery life.

In addition to this, if the app is running and removed from the battery optimization list ( in your settings ) it will also
turn OFF the wifi when entering DOZE mode & turn it back on when leaving DOZE.
